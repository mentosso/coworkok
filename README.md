**CoWorkOk**
# CoWorking - find and rent a desk
Hi there! First of all - thanks for you application.
It is a great opportunity to rocketfuel yourself in developing Django apps and becoming the next member of DOOK.pro team.
Please remember, that coding should be first of all fun.
Keeping fingers crossed to see you during our workshop. Good luck!

## The problem this app should solve:

Let CoWorkOK be a simple app for users - to find a desk in one of co-working offices in a city, and for companies - to rent their available desks/space to people.
Maybe sometime it will be given a life as a standalone product for offices.

### Setup:

1. Clone this repository (`git clone git@github.com:dook/coworkok.git`)

2. Install requirements (`pip install -r requirements.txt`), probably you should use virtualenv for this.

3. Setup database, use postgreSql 9.1+


### What you have to do (tasks with * are not necessary, but we welcome them a lot):

# Backend:

1. Extend Company model, for example add fields like: VAT-ID, website, company logo (needs for other task).

2. Extend Location model, add: address, postal code etc.

4. Add searching for desk by city.

5. Add geolocation fields and use [PostGIS](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/contrib/gis/install/postgis/) to setup search by location.

6. Make location view more dynamic.

7. User should be able to rent a desk.

7. User should register before he rent a desk.

8. Add filtration so user can choose if he want to see all locations or only one with open desks.


# Frontend:

1. In index.html file there are two h2 elements which have 'index-header' class, modify it so text is centered both verticaly and horizontaly.

2. Arrange single searching result based on below mockup ![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dook/coworkok/master/mockup.jpg)

3*. Create javascript dynamic search to list available desks via AngularJS


# Tests:

1. Add unit tests for registration form

2*. Try to use [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org) to test registration flow


### What you shouldn't do:

1. Hardcode.
2. Miss the tests.
3. Forget to set up an app on heroku.com or migrate the db.
